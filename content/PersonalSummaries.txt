CAREVION OVERVIEW:
I graduated at the end of last year, and I have my bachelors in computer science and minor in data science.

My first and current job out of college is consulting for a healthcare startup developing a SaaS that integrates AI into a healthcare payor's infrastructure.

Since we are creating an agentic AI layer that sits on top of existing management systems, our first step was to create a mock management system (payor system) that we can later use to demo our service. 

My first task was to set up a mock patient records server very similar to how a typical small hospital would run. We set this all up on AWS so I learned about some things there, as well as PostgreSQL. 

I also worked with Python to interface with the java server, so we could do basic input/output operations and populate our static server with synthetic patient files.

However, since I was already well-versed in web development using React, my next step was to create the startup's public facing landing page, through which I learned basic cycles of web design and interface. I did create some more advanced UI components from scratch, including a slide carousel and more complex card style layouts

The next big group of tasks I had was to help build out various functions and calculators that will be used on the agent's backend. For example, based on the AI models we currently have in place, we can compare our AI-assisted metrics to standard metrics, and we can show how using our agentic solution can save healthcare payors across various impacts. 

Lastly, right now I have been working in web development using React again, and I have been building out a mock, or demo version of our app to showcase the functionality we could provide to prospective clients. This I think is really cool because I get to work directly with the CEO, CTO and highly-accomplished clinical providers, to build this app which is then showcased directly to various panels of high-ranking executives of various healthcare firms who may want to invest in our product.

It’s definitely a bit of a stressful job knowing the kinds of people I'm working with and who will be seeing my work’s output directly, and the hours are also a little crazy because sometimes some large changes are requested just days before a big demo, but overall I think it’s given me a lot of insight, experience, and work ethic working in a super fast paced startup environment.

---

and aside from all this, I am doing my own personal research, learning things in AWS, Next.JS, database relationships, and I'm applying these skills towards a freelance SaaS development for a personal client. 

and then on the weekends I do computer science and game development tutoring, along with some light small business management for the business that I run my tutoring services out of.

VISA:
I'm a budding and passionate software engineer with hands-on experience in software engineering, full stack development, cloud infrastructure, AI pipelines, and data-driven solutions. Above all, I enjoy the trial of turning business needs into practical, reliable software. Visa’s focus on secure and accessible payments on such a broad scale aligns with my interests, and the scale of Visa's systems is the kind of challenge I want to work on. In my projects I’ve owned features end to end, set up automated workflow pipelines, and used data to guide decisions. I also leverage AI to enhance the quality and speed of my work, using it as a powerful assistant that streamlines research, analysis, and execution. However, I still take care in bringing my own expertise and judgment to ensure accuracy and oversight. I’d be glad to help build and operate services for Visa, taking care with performance, reliability, and clear documentation, while learning from experienced engineers. Thank you for considering my application.




AWS:

story: I’ve shipped a serverless SaaS: React on the front end with Amplify-powered Cognito auth; API Gateway (JWT authorizer) to Python Lambdas; DynamoDB for users/OTPs; EventBridge for scheduled jobs; everything defined in SAM and monitored with CloudWatch. For heavier or containerized workloads, I’ve used EC2. I’ve set up CI/CD with CodeBuild/CodeDeploy/CodePipeline so changes go from commit → build/test → SAM deploy with safe rollbacks and alarms.

EC2
What: Elastic compute on VMs; good for long-running/containerized services.
What I did: Deployed Dockerized services for healthcare prototypes; secured with SGs/IAM; set up basic monitoring with CloudWatch.
Learned: When to choose EC2 over serverless (steady workloads, custom runtimes) and how to harden instances + automate provisioning.
S3
What: Durable object storage for static assets, backups, logs.
What I did: Stored static resources and generated artifacts; used pre-signed URLs where needed.
Learned: Lifecycle policies/versioning to control costs and safe rollbacks.
DynamoDB
What: Serverless NoSQL (key-value/Document) with single-digit ms latency.
What I did: Tables for users/metadata/OTPs; TTL for expiring OTPs; conditional writes for idempotent updates.
Learned: Model access patterns first; use PK/SK and sparse items to keep queries fast and cheap.
API Gateway
What: Managed front door for REST/HTTP APIs (auth, throttling, CORS).
What I did: Fronted Python Lambdas; JWT authorizer validating Cognito tokens; configured CORS and usage plans.
Learned: Map claims → app roles; rate limits and stage variables simplify multi-env deployments.
Cognito / Web Authentication & JWT
What: Token-based auth; clients present signed JWTs with claims.
What I did: Issued Cognito JWTs; verified in API Gateway/Lambda authorizer; enforced role-based access (user groups).
Learned: Keep tokens short-lived; store safely in the browser; least-privilege via claims, not custom headers.
Cognito (+Amplify)
What: Managed user pools, auth flows, and hosted UI; Amplify ties auth into React.
What I did: User groups/roles; custom auth triggers with Pinpoint; integrated Amplify Auth in React SPA (sign-in/out, token refresh).
Learned: Use groups/claims for RBAC; secure redirects/CORS; keep UX smooth with Amplify hooks.
AWS Lambda
What: Serverless functions for event-driven/back-end tasks.
What I did: REST handlers, Stripe webhook processors, scheduled jobs, content generation; Python runtime with Layers for deps.
Learned: Fast cold starts via smaller packages; idempotency keys + retries; structure logs for easy CloudWatch search.
CloudWatch (logs, metrics, alerts)
What: Logging/metrics/alarms for AWS workloads.
What I did: Created log groups, metric filters for errors/throttles, alarms on latency/5xx, notifications.
Learned: Emit structured JSON logs; set SLIs/SLO-aligned alarms (error rate, p95 latency, throttles).
IaC with SAM (+CloudFormation)
What: Declarative templates for serverless stacks (APIs, Lambdas, roles, env vars).
What I did: SAM templates to define APIs, functions, permissions, schedules; repeatable envs; parameterized configs.
Learned: Review changesets; keep infra in the repo; per-stage stacks avoid drift and make rollbacks safe.
EventBridge
What: Event bus + scheduler (rules/cron) to connect services.
What I did: Scheduled dispatches (digest emails, data sync, maintenance) triggering Lambdas.
Learned: Prefer EventBridge over ad-hoc crons; dead-letter targets help observe failures.
CI/CD (CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline)
What: Build/test/deploy automation across stages.
What I did: Built pipelines that compile/test Lambdas/React, package SAM, and deploy by stage; environment secrets via IAM/Parameters.
Learned: Small, repeatable buildspecs; artifact versioning; staged deploys with alarms as deployment gates.
