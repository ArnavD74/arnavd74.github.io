AboutAbout
Hands-on engineer working across software development and data science. Love to learn by building with new tools and technologies :]

My background spans full-stack engineering (React, Node, Python), cloud (AWS), and data science/ML workflows. I'm most engaged when I can move between these areas rather than stay siloed in one.

The United Stated Food and Drug Administration estimates that in 2022, around 30 to 40% of food supply is wasted every day. Meanwhile, it is estimated that between twelve and twenty million people rely on soup kitchens daily as their food source. 

Our mission is to eliminate food waste as much as possible. We introduce restaurants and other food processing facilities with soup kitchens and food relief foundations. Rubi is a platform where this can occur seamlessly, allowing connection between the excess and the need.

The FIRST Impact Award (formerly Chairman’s Award) is the most prestigious award at FIRST; it honors the team that best represents a model for other teams to emulate and best embodies the mission of FIRST.

As Logistics Manager, I led cross-functional operations for a 100+ member team. This included coordinating award entries and presentations, streamlining communications, and organizing targeted community initiatives.
